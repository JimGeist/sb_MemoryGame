# sb_MemoryGame
Find the 5 matching color pairs in as few moves as possible.

Colors are randomly assigned to divs and the game player needs to find the matching pairs.

*Restart Game* button restarts the game without re-shuffling the colors. The score automatically starts at 10 on a game restart because the 
game player may already know all the color locations.

*Start Game* starts a new game with re-shuffled colors.
